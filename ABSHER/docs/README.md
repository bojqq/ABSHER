🚀 Abshr Proactive Assistant System (MVP)

Track: Abshr Services Innovation and Development

Tagline: Transforming Abshr from Reactive to Proactive.

💡 I. The Problem & MVP Solution

1. The Core Problem

Most e-government services require users to manually track document expiration dates, navigate complex menus, and repeatedly fill out forms, leading to wasted time and increased errors.

2. The Solution (PSA API)

The Proactive Services API (PSA) is an intelligent system that monitors all critical user data (licenses, passports, ID milestones). It automatically prepares the required service—from pre-filling forms to securing payment readiness—and presents it to the user for one-click final approval.

3. Core Value (MVP Focus)

Anticipation: The system acts before the user needs to.

96% Time Savings: Reduces a multi-step process (approx. 30 minutes) to a single action (approx. 1 minute).

Frictionless Experience: Eliminates navigation, errors, and manual data entry.

⚙️ II. The Proactive Workflow

The PSA API operates through a continuous 5-step automated cycle:

Input & Monitoring: Continuous tracking of all critical dates (expirations, age milestones).

Prediction Logic: Determines the required mandatory service and the ideal time to intervene.

Pre-fill & Preparation: Automatically prepares the entire transaction (fills forms, checks compliance, prepares fees/appointments).

Notification Trigger: Sends a specific, actionable Sticky Alert Card to the user.

Execution: User taps 'Approve,' and the transaction is finalized instantly.

🛠️ III. MVP Demonstration Scope

To validate the concept, the prototype focuses on the "Sticky Alert Card" approach, showcasing the transition from complex steps to a single approval.

1. Scenario: Driver's License Renewal

Setup: The prototype simulates the PSA detecting a license renewal due in 45 days, completing all necessary checks (fines, fitness, fees).

Phase 1: The Alert: Upon opening the app, a prominent "Proactive Alert" banner appears on the home screen.

Goal: Demonstrate instant anticipation and visibility.

Phase 2: Single-Click Action: Tapping the alert bypasses all search/form pages and opens the dedicated Review Screen.

Goal: Prove the API's efficiency by showing pre-filled data and a single "Approve and Pay" button.

Phase 3: Value Confirmation: A success message confirms the renewal and explicitly states the time saved (e.g., 25 minutes).

2. Key Metrics Highlighted

Time Savings: Demonstrated visually by the jump from the home screen to execution.

Operational Efficiency: Proved by the pre-filled, compliant, and ready-to-execute service.

Reduced Visits: Confirmed by the automated handling of all preparation steps.

🎯 IV. Financial Impact & Future

Financial Impact (Savings)

Achieving 96% time savings per transaction directly translates to millions of SAR saved annually in administrative hours.

Reduces pressure on service centers by 40% by eliminating procedure errors and unnecessary visits.

Future Goals

Expand predictive services to the Business Sector and Corporations.

Develop Geolocation-Based service recommendations.
